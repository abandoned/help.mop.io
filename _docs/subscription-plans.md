Starter - The Starter Plan allows every seller to take advantage of mopio's basic algorithms in an affordable way. Our Starter algorithms are simple but powerful. If you choose this plan, Mopio will help you to win the buy box and maximise your profits. However, you will not be able to use certain advanced features and customisation options available to customers on the Plus and Pro subscription plans.

Plus -  The Plus Plan allows medium-sized customers to use more sophisticated and efficient versions of our algorithms. These algorithms are distinguished in using mathematical modeling and machine learning technology. They try to predict price trends on Amazon and allow you to stay ahead of the competition in times of rapid change. The Plus algorithms will also learn to adapt to your particular requirements as they gain experience of your business. The Plus Plan is suitable for medium-sized sellers.

Pro - The Pro Plan caters for large customers with special requirements. We offer bespoke solutions integrating our algorithms into a variety of business solutions. Please get in touch with us for details.
