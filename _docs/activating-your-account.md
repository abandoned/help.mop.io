During signup, we'll guide you through a few simple steps to integrate your Mopio account with the Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS).

1. First, you will choose your Amazon marketplace.
2. Then, we'll redirect you to your MWS portal, where you will authorise Mopio to connect to your seller account through MWS.
3. On the final screen, Amazon will provide you your **Seller ID** and an **Auth Token**. You will enter these back into Mopio.

Once you have completed integration, it will take a minute or two to sync your existing inventory and activate the real-time data feed we'll use to reprice.
