Thank you for activating Mopio. By design, Mopio is effective and easy to use. We want you to get the best out of Mopio from day one. If you have any questions or comments at any stage, feel free to contact us. We are here to help you.

## What will happen now?

Mopio will automatically pull information about your existing inventory from Amazon. We will then start analysing your prices and other data that are relevant to your competitive position in the marketplace. Finally, we will start to adjust your prices automatically so that you can maximise your profits.

## How can I get the best out of Mopio?  

Mopio has sensible defaults, so you can start using Mopio without any further set-up or customisation if you like. We tuck away the complexity of dynamic pricing behind simple business goals. We have deliberately designed mopio to be intuitive, powerful and effective.

We offer a set of parameters that you can customise if you choose to do so. You can find these parameters by clicking on the Settings tab in Mopio. The Settings tab will also guide you in making the right choices for your business.

## How does Mopio work?

In a nutshell, we use real-time data from Amazon to drive a set of pricing algorithms in line with your business goals. Some of the algorithms are simple; others are quite sophisticated and technical. You can see a list of algorithms that are available to you by clicking on the Settings tab in Mopio. We describe each algorithm by identifying its immediate business goal. This enables you to understand the business value of each algorithm without having to become a computer expert.

## How can I get more information?

If you are not familiar with real-time data and repricing on Amazon, it may take a short while for everything to make sense to you. That's normal. If you have any questions or comments in the first few days, please get in touch with us immediately. We will help you to get the best out of Mopio every day. We are here to help.

In practice, the best way to understand Mopio is to start using it immediately. You will find helpful explanations of our features when you click on the Settings tab.
