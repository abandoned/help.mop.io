You have activated your account and may be wondering what will happen next.

In the background, Mopio will start syncing your existing inventory and tracking changes on Amazon in real time. As changes come in, we'll review your listings and make small adjustments to maintain or improve your competitive position.

Mopio has sensible defaults. We expect that most sellers can start using Mopio without any further setup or change. We tuck away the complexity of dynamic pricing behind intuitive business goals.

You can tweak how Mopio behaves in two ways:

1. You can define an application-wide strategy on the **Settings** page.
2. You can define specific goals for each individual listing.

The latter will override the application-wide strategy.


## Strategy

You will want to start by setting a **business goal**. The default goal is to *win the Buy Box*. You can change this to *match* or *beat the lowest price*. These seem to work better if you are selling mostly in the Media categories.

If you choose to compete for the lowest price and sell used items, you can tweak your strategy to ignore listings in worse condition.

You may also want to adjust the conservative default values we have set for **Maximum Allowed Discount (MAD)** and **Maximum Allowed Markup (MAM)**. These percentages help us calculate a floor and ceiling for your listings based on their original prices. A MAD of 10% means that something originally listed for $50 will always remain above $45.

Finally, you have an option to set an **absolute floor**. This comes in handy if you have a very aggressive MAD but want to ensure you never sell below a certain price. An absolute floor of $2 means that your listings will always be priced above $2, even if MAD would have pulled it further below.

## Listings

If application-wide settings don't work for you, you will want to tweak listings individually. You can do so by editing the listings one-by-one or importing a flat file.

You can define a **business goal** for each listing. This will override the app-wide goal.

Similarly, you can set a **floor** and **ceiling** for each listing. These will override what we would have calculated using your MAD, MAM, and absolute floor.

If you set a floor of $25 and ceiling of $30 for a listing, we will work within those limits only, choosing what it believes is the optimal price point. If competing offers fall below your floor, we'll stop at the floor. Conversely, we'll never exceed your ceiling even if there is no competition.

If you are not familiar with repricing on Amazon, it may take a short while for things to make sense. That's normal. If you have any questions or comments in the first few days, please get in touch with us. We'll help you get the best out of Mopio!
