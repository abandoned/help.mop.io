Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) is a web service that helps sellers programmatically exchange data on their listings, orders and more. We use MWS to receive real-time marketplace notifications and send back inventory updates.

When you sign up, we'll guide you through integrating Mopio with your seller account through MWS. You need a professional seller account to use MWS. If you don't have one, you can upgrade easily through Amazon Seller Central.
