## Goal.

This is where you choose the business goal that you want Mopio to pursue. You can select a global Goal in the Settings section.

After you've chosen your business goal, Mopio will select the appropriate algorithm from its portfolio in order to achieve your business goal. The portfolio of algorithms you have access to varies according to the subscription you have with us. With Mopio, you always stay in charge of your own business requirements. We take care of the technical details in the background.

### Beat Lowest Price: If you choose to Beat Lowest Price, you are instructing Mopio to beat your lowest priced competitor by the tiniest margin. This will win you the buy box in most cases, but there are exceptions.

### Match Lowest Price:  

If you choose to Match Lowest Price, you are instructing Mopio to match your competitor's price. This option is useful when you don't want to stop a price war with an aggressive competitor.  

### Win Buy Box:  

If you choose Win Buy Box, Mopio will win you the buy box at the best possible price. Amazon uses a complex set of rules for determining the buy box winner. Sometimes, you can't win the buy box simply by being 1p cheaper than your competitors. Our algorithms find the highest price that will win you the buy box. For some items, this may be 5p or 10p below the nearest price. We also take your floor and maximum allowed discount values into account.


### Ignore Listings in Worse Condition. If you tick this box, Mopio will only compete against listings that are in the same condition or better.
