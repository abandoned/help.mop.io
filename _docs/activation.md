We use Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) to receive real-time marketplace notifications for your seller account. During signup, we'll guide you through a few simple steps to integrate your Mopio account with MWS.

1. First, we'll ask you for your name. This is just so we know who to say "Hi" to.
2. Second, you will choose your Amazon marketplace.
2. Then, we'll redirect you to your MWS portal, where you will authorise Mopio to connect to your seller account.
3. On the final screen, Amazon will provide you your **Seller ID** and an **Auth Token**. You will enter these back into Mopio.

Once you have completed integration, your account will be active. You can then review and configure your app-wide settings. It will take a minute or two for us to sync your inventory and set up the real-time data feed.
