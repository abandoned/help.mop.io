We use Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) to receive real-time marketplace notifications for and otherwise exchange data with your seller account.

During signup, we'll guide you through a few simple steps to set us up with MWS.

1. First, we'll ask you for your name. This is just so we know who to say "Hi" to!
2. You will then choose your Amazon marketplace.
2. Next, we'll redirect you to your MWS portal, where you will authorise Mopio to connect to your seller account.
3. On the final screen, Amazon will provide you your **Seller ID** and an **Auth Token**. You will enter these back into Mopio.

Once you have completed these steps, your account should activate within a few seconds. You can then review and configure your app-wide settings. It will take another minute or two for Mopio to sync your inventory and the real-time data feed to start sending in updates.

If anything goes wrong, we will bump you to a failure page so we can troubleshoot together your credentials.
