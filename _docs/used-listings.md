If you're listing a used item, we will price against offers with lower conditions as long as they are eligible for the Buy Box.


We have stopped offering a more fine-grained option where we'd only compete against other listings with the same or better condition. We consider it a futile exercise to determine whether a buyer will favour a *$19.80* item in very good condition over a *$19.75* one in good condition.

We simply compete for the Buy Box, which overrides all minor differences between listings.
