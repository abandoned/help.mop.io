Mopio allows you to globally set a relative margin within which it will reprice your listings.

For example, if you set your relative margin to *5%*, a listing with a base price of *$50* will only be priced between *$47.50* and *$52.50*. You can think of these values as the floor and ceiling of the listing price. If your competition goes below your floor or above your ceiling, Mopio will stop at the limit. Otherwise, your price moves between the two values, depending on competing prices.
